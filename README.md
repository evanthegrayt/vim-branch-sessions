# Branch Sessions
Easily create/load sessions based on git branches, or current directory if not
in a git repository.

This is a work in progress, but it works. Just be aware that things might change
in the near future, and better documentation is coming soon. There is
rudimentary documentation in `docs/branch_sessions.txt`.

Consider making the following alias.
```sh
alias vims='vim -c SessionLoad'
```
