COMMANDS                                              *branch-sessions-commands*

:Mksession[!] [{session}]   Like |:mksession|, but create a session file based
                            on current directory. If the current directory is a
                            git repository, make a directory named after the
                            current directory and a session file named after
                            the current git branch.  If {session} is specified,
                            that name will be used instead. Session files are
                            kept in "$HOME/.cache/vim_sessions", but the
                            directory can be changed with
                            |g:branch_sessions_directory|. To mimic the
                            behavior of |:mksession|, if the session file
                            already exists, it will result in an error, but you
                            can call with "!" to overwrite the current session
                            file. This can be tedious, so you can set
                            |g:branch_sessions_mksession_bang| to 1 to always
                            call |:mksession| with a "!".

                                                                 *:SessionStart*
:SessionStart [{session}]   Like |:Mksession|, but continue tracking any
                            changes. Must have tpope's vim-obsession installed.

                                                                  *:SessionLoad*
:SessionLoad [{session}]    Load the session file for the current directory. If
                            the current directory is a git repository, load the
                            session file for the current directory and branch.

                                                                *:SessionDelete*
:SessionDelete [{session}]  Delete the session file for the current directory.
                            If the current directory is a git repository, delete
                            the session file for the current directory and
                            branch.

SETTINGS                                              *branch-sessions-settings*

The following values should be set in your vimrc file.

                                                   *g:branch_sessions_directory*
Change the session file directory~

To change the default session file directory, you can set the following variable.

>
    let g:branch_sessions_directory = $HOME . '/.vim/cache/sessions'
<

                                              *g:branch_sessions_mksession_bang*
Automatically call :Mksession with a !~

To automatically call |:Mksession| with a bang, which will always overwrite the
current session file, you can set the following variable.

>
    let g:branch_sessions_mksession_bang = 1
<
