                                                                    *:Mksession*
:Mksession[!] [{session}]   Like |mksession|, but create a session file based
                            on current directory. If current directory is a git
                            repository, make a session file for the current
                            directory plus the current branch. Session files
                            are kept in "$HOME/.cache/vim_sessions", but the
                            directory can be changed with
                            *g:branch_sessions_directory*. You can also set
                            *g:branch_sessions_mksession_bang* to 1 to always
                            call |mksession| with a "!".

                                                                 *:SessionStart*
:SessionStart [{session}]   Like |Mksession|, but continue tracking any window
                            changes. Must have tpope's vim-obsession installed.

                                                                  *:SessionLoad*
:SessionLoad [{session}]    Load the session file for the current directory. If
                            the current directory is a git repository, load the
                            session file for the current directory and branch.

                                                                *:SessionDelete*
:SessionDelete [{session}]  Delete the session file for the current directory.
                            If the current directory is a git repository, delete
                            the session file for the current directory and
                            branch.
